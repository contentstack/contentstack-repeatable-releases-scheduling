# Contentstack Repeatable Releases Scheduling

Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach that puts content at the centre. It is designed to simplify the process of publication by separating code from content.

You can use Contentstack with AWS Lambda to create useful automated systems. They can be combined to automate the process of creating and deploying releases in Contentstack.
This eliminates the need of creating releases manually. You simply need to add your items to the release and they will get deployed on the specified environment at the scheduled time (specified through the script).

## Tutorial

We have created an in-depth tutorial on the demonstrating the lambda function used for this automation.Below is a a screenshot of autogenerated release using AWS lambda.
